Test 1D Laplacian of order 24000
Step 1: Create Mg handle and select devices 
	There are 1 GPUs 
	Device 0, NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB, cc 8.0 
step 2: Enable peer access.
Step 3: Allocate host memory A 
Step 4: Prepare 1D Laplacian 
Step 5: Create matrix descriptors for A and B 
Step 6: Allocate distributed matrices A and D 
Step 7: Prepare data on devices 
Step 8: Allocate workspace space 
	Allocate device workspace, lwork = 49561600 
Step 9: Solve A*X = B by GETRF and GETRS 
Total time used (s): 1.1161
Step 10: Retrieve IPIV and solution vector X
Step 11: Measure residual error |b - A*x| 

|b - A*x|_inf = 1.920686E-14
|x|_inf = 2.792042E-05
|b|_inf = 1.000000E+00
|A|_inf = 4.000000E+00
|b - A*x|/(|A|*|x|+|b|) = 1.920471E-14
